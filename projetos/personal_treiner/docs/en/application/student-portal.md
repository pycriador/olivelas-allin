# student-portal

> Language: EN | [Português (pt-BR)](../../pt-BR/application/student-portal.md)

## Purpose

Student-side experience of the Rafaela Personal App: view prescribed workouts, execute them with tappable UI, log real sets, request substitutions, skip exercises with reason, and review history/evolution/nutrition.

## Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Evidence | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Student dashboard (today's workout card, streak, recent sessions) | `src/pages/student/StudentDashboardPage.tsx` | Confirmed |
| Active workout execution (frame player, rest timer, +/-, substitution, skip) | `StudentActiveWorkoutPage.tsx` | Confirmed |
| Workout list | `StudentWorkoutsListPage.tsx` | Confirmed |
| History (sessions + modifications) | `StudentHistoryPage.tsx` | Confirmed |
| Student evolution charts | `StudentEvolutionPage.tsx` | Confirmed |
| Nutrition plan with substitutions + demo disclaimer | `StudentNutritionPage.tsx` | Confirmed |
| Profile (theme, logout, switch-to-personal) | `StudentProfilePage.tsx` | Confirmed |
| Simulation banner + simulated student switch (no writes) | `StudentLayout.tsx` (`exitStudentSimulation`, `enterStudentSimulation`) | Confirmed |
| Seeded trainer conversation thread | Via `messageRepository` data in trainer's chat (read-only for student sessions today) | Confirmed |

## Non-Responsibilities

- Not responsible for prescribing or auditing (trainer side).
- Does not write nutrition plans directly (trainer does).
- Does not expose the trainer message composer (chat UI lives in the trainer's student detail page).

## Simulation mode

While "Test as student" is active, the layout shows a **Modo Simulação** banner, allows switching the simulated student (dropdown), and an **Encerrar Teste** action that restores the trainer session. All data changes land in the `sessionStorage` sandbox only.

> See [../contracts/local-storage.md](../contracts/local-storage.md) and [../decisions/adr-005-simulation-sandbox.md](../decisions/adr-005-simulation-sandbox.md).
