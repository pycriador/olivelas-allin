## Gaps

| Item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Real authentication (Supabase Auth / JWT) | Unknown | Mock auth only; LoginPage declares it as next step |
| SLIs / SLOs | Unknown / Not Defined | No numeric targets exist; do not invent |
| Formal threat model | Unknown | Security overview exists, no formal model |
| Observability platform integration | Not Documented | No metrics/tracing exporter configured |
| Formal disaster recovery / RPO / RTO | Not Defined | MVP stage |
| Real-time sync semantics | Partial | Realtime audit feed; write path details not exhaustively documented |
| Exercise count drift | Inferred | README states 32/96 while catalog ships 302/1,002 — docs should prefer current state above |
| Student experience edge-cases | Partial | Active workout UI behaviors partially documented only |
| `student_messages` / `workout_templates` tables | Not in migration | Queries error in a fresh Supabase → localStorage fallback; parity gap |
| Version/feedback columns on `workout_plans`/`workout_sessions` | Not in migration | Mapped in code only; schema drift risk |
| `student-avatars` bucket provisioning | Not automated | Fresh Supabase needs manual bucket creation |
| Password reset semantics | Confirmed cosmetic | Generates a password but `login` ignores it (mock) |
| Student-side chat surface | Unknown | Chat UI exists in trainer detail; student consumption not clearly wired |

## Explicitly Not Applicable

| Item | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Message brokers / event bus | No queue infrastructure in repo |
| Server-side API framework | No backend runtime; Supabase hosted services only |
| CI for docs validation | No docs lint pipeline in this repo |

## About the framework

The `aiops-documentation` repository defines the **structure/format standard**. This repository is an adopting project: it mirrors the structure and conventions with **original content** lifted from this codebase. The standard itself remains authoritative for its own methodology.
