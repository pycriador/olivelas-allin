## Purpose

Describe what is observable about the Rafaela Personal App today, honestly — including what is **not** observable. No structured logging, metrics, or tracing exists; everything below is browser console or CI output.

## Observable signals today

| Signal | Source | Value | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Supabase write failures | `console.error('Supabase ... error:', err)` in repositories | Error text + exception | Confirmed |
| Supabase config status | `src/lib/supabase.ts` (boolean) + `.env` presence | Is Supabase on? | Confirmed |
| localStorage read/write failures | `console.error` in `storage.ts` | Key + error | Confirmed |
| Supabase Storage upload fallback | `console.warn('Supabase storage fallback...')` in `StudentManagerSection` | Warning text | Confirmed |
| Simulation mode state | sessionStorage flag (`rafaela_simulation_mode`) | On/off + student id | Confirmed |
| Dashboard/report data load errors | `console.error` in personal/student pages | Error text | Confirmed |
| Seed script progress | `scripts/seed-supabase.cjs` stdout/stderr | Counts, per-table | Confirmed |
| CI build+deploy | GitHub Actions logs | Step output | Confirmed |
| HTTP API reachability | Supabase client errors surfaced at call sites | Per-request error | Inferred |

## NOT observable today

| Signal | Gap | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Real user traffic | No analytics/tracing | Confirmed |
| Runtime errors aggregated | No error-reporting service | Confirmed |
| Supabase dashboard | External, operator-view only (not wired) | Inferred |
| Performance metrics | None | Confirmed |
| Uptime/SLO | None (static hosting; GitHub status is source) | Inferred |

## Where findings surface

| Path | For | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Browser DevTools console | Local/app runtime errors | Primary today |
| GitHub Actions job logs | Deploy + lint | `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` |
| Supabase Dashboard | DB health/usage | Manual |

## Recommended evolution (future)

| Item | Status | Stated as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Error reporting (e.g. Sentry) | Planned | Proposed |
| Structured console logging | Considered | Proposed |
| Uptime/monitoring on Pages | Considered | Proposed |
